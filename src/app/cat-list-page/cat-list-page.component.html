            <h2>Buy Computers &amp; Accessories Online</h2>
            <p>There are a lot of things to consider when going for a <strong>computing device</strong>; either a desktop computer or a <a title="laptop" href="https://www.konga.com/laptops-5230" target="_blank">laptop</a>. It actually depends on your need
                for the device as three major things come to play and they include: the screen for a large display, the RAM size for the optimum speed and memory for the space to save the documents and projects you might have going on. The desktop <strong>computer</strong>                is the ideal device to get when you are in a stationary and permanent workstation, with the <strong>desktop</strong> you are able to get the best a computer has to offer because you get a much bigger screen than the laptop and it is equipped
                with a capable CPU that ensures the performance of the device is at its best. The RAM and memory space of a desktop is usually easily upgraded, meaning by the time the current memory space is exhausted, you can have it upgraded and your
                work continues without any stress. The computing brands that produce desktop computers include Hp, DELL, Toshiba &amp; more. Other peripherals that would make operations go smoothly include an all-in-one printer that includes a photocopier,
                a printer, and a scanner. Gone are the days where you have the 3 machines differently because we at Konga know what is right for you and we donâ€™t want you to go through any stress at all that is why we urge to always shop online with us.&nbsp;</p>
